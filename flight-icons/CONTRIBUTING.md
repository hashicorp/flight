# Flight-Icons "sync/build/release" scripts

A set of Node.js scripts developed to create a single pipeline for building and releasing the Flight iconset as a set of packages in different formats, that can be consumed by other tools and products.

The pipeline can be run manually, on your local machine, or via GitHub actions.

-----

## Releasing a new npm version of the package

Whenever there is an update to the Flight Icons library in Figma (eg. a new icon is added), these changes need to be transfered also to the code. This means re-syncing and re-building the `flight-icons` package and then release it to the npm registry.

_Remember: once released a package on the public registry, you can't revert the changes: the only solution is to deprecate the package (this will hide it from the public, but remains there)._

The update process for the icons should happen in a dedicated branch, associated with the GitHub task/issue. Once you have run the `yarn sync` and `yarn build` (see the instructions below), check the diff in your git client, and once you're OK with them commit & push the changes to the branch, and then open a pull request in GitHub.

Once this request has been approved and the branch merged in `main`, you bump the _semver_ version via `yarn bump` (see the instructions below), open a new pull request, and once this is approved and merged to master, you can finally and safely release the package to the registry via `yarn release` (see the instructions below).

Please follow the steps in the sections below, which describe with more details the process.

If you need a TLDR; here's the sequence of steps you have to follow:

- `cd /[your-local-project-path]/flight-icons`
- create custom branch from `main`
- `yarn sync`
- `yarn build`
- commit, push, open PR, wait for approval
- pull from main
- `cd /[your-local-project-path]/flight-icons`
- create new custom branch from `main`
- `yarn bump`
- choose _semver_ version
- commit, push, open PR, wait for approval
- pull from main
- `cd /[your-local-project-path]/flight-icons`
- `yarn release`
- `cd /[your-local-project-path]/ember-flight-icons`
- `yarn release`
- check [www.npmjs.com/package/@hashicorp/flight-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hashicorp/flight-icons)
- profit! ðŸŽ‰

## Initial setup


*Notice: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) needs to be installed on your local machine.*

First of all clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hashicorp/flight
```

Then install the project dependencies:

```bash
# go to the "main" folder
cd /[your-local-project-path]/flight-icons

# install node modules
yarn install
```

#### Figma Token

To access the Figma file via REST API is necessary to have [a special authentication token](https://www.figma.com/developers/api#access-tokens). This token is personal, should not be shared or committed to the repo.

To create your personal access token, open Figma and go into *Account > Personal access tokens* and create one for yourself.

Next, add a `.env` file in the `scripts` directory, to which you will add the variable:

`FIGMA_TOKEN=###`

where `###` is your personal access token. You can use the `.env.template` file you find in the repository as model, if you want.

**IMPORTANT**: the `.env` file is ignored by git, and should not be committed to the repository.


Once you've done the initial setup, there are three distinct steps in the process that you can follow.

## Sync

The "sync" step exports the assets from Figma and saves them in the project.
You can find the code that relates to this step in the file `/scripts/sync.ts`.

To run this script launch the following commands in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):

```bash
yarn sync
```

This action will:

* Retrieve the assets metadata from Figma via REST API
* Export the assets as `.svg` files into `./svg-original/`
* Generate the `catalog.json` file

## Build

The "build" step takes the assets exported from Figma, optimize and process them, and saves the final SVG files in the bundles that will be published as npm packages.
You can find the code that relates to this step in the file `/scripts/build.ts`.

To run this script use the following command in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):

```bash
yarn build
```

This action will:

* Optimize the SVG files and save then in a `temp` folder
* Process the optimized SVG files and save then in the `svg` folder
* Update the existing files in the Ember addon folder:
    * Process the optimized SVG, generate a SVG sprite, and overwrite the existing sprite
    * Overwrite the catalog.json with the new one

_**Notice**: this step not only updates the content of the `flight-icons` folder, but also the content of the `ember-flight-icons`. You will see these changes reflected in your git diff status._

When this step is done, and you have committed and pushed all the changes, submit a pull request in GitHub. Once approved and merged to the `main` branch, you can move to the next step.

## Bump

The "bump" step increases the version number in the `package.json` file.

Use the following command in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):

```bash
yarn bump
```

This action will:

* ask you which _semver_ version you want to to use (the `bump` command is interactive, you can move up and down with the keyboard, choose one option, and then hit "enter").
* update the version in the `package.json` file

When this step is done, commit and push the changes to the `package.json` file, and submit a new pull request in GitHub. Once also this one has been approved and merged to the `main` branch, you can finally move to the last step, the actual release.

## Release

The "release" step publishes the package on the npm registry (using the version declared in the `package.json` file).

Use the following command in your CLI (while in the `flight-icons` folder):


```bash
yarn release
```

_**IMPORTANT**: if you need to do some tests, use a **local** package registry (see below), don't test directly in production!_

This action will:

* ask which _semver_ version you want to to use (the `bump` command is interactive, you can move up and down with the keyboard, choose one option, and then hit "enter").
* update the version in the `package.json` file
* automatically publish the new version of the `@hashicorp/flight-icons` package on the [NPM registry](https://www.npmjs.com/)
  * _Notice: you will need a company-approved account on npm (with 2FA) to publish._

At this point check on [www.npmjs.com/package/@hashicorp/flight-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hashicorp/flight-icons) that the package has been successfully published (under the "versions" tab) and you're good. Well done, you just published your new package! ðŸŽ‰

ðŸš¨ **DON'T FORGET**: if you're releasing a new version of `@hashicorp/flight-icons`, this means that during the `build` step the SVG sprite and the `catalog.json` file in the `ember-flight-icons/` have also been updated, which means you have to release also that package.

## Local development

If you need to work on the scripts locally, here some useful information.

### Code check

You can also do some important sanity checks to the code via the commands:

```bash
# check type safety
yarn typecheck

# check code syntax
yarn lint
```

### Using a local NPM registry for testing

To test the release of packages without actually polluting the real/production npm registry, you cansetup a local registry using [Verdaccio](https://verdaccio.org/docs/what-is-verdaccio), an open source solution, very easy to setup and use.

You can follow [the instructions here](https://verdaccio.org/docs/installation) but essentially what you have to:

- install the package: `npm install -g verdaccio` - this will install it globally
- launch the service: `verdaccio` - this will serve a web frontend to the registry at the URL http://localhost:4873/
- add a user to the registry: `npm adduser --registry http://localhost:4873` - this will ask you a username/password/email, I suggest to use test/test/test@test.com because is just a local instance; this will also authenticate you with the registry so when you publish yuo don't need to login.

Now you need to add this entry in the `package.json` files of `flight-icons`:

```
"publishConfig": {
    "registry": "http://localhost:4873"
},
```

This will make sure the package is published on Verdaccio. Once the package is published, the web frontend accesible at http://localhost:4873/ will show you all the details about the packages (and if needed you can also download the tarballs, to check their content).

Once you've done testing, you can remove verdaccio via `npm uninstall -g verdaccio` and then remove the files he created using `rm -fr ~/.local/share/verdaccio && rm -fr .config/verdaccio`. You can use the same command to cleanup the entire data storage of Verdaccio and start from scratch (no need to reinstall for this, just cleanup the data).

## ðŸš§ [WIP] GitHub action

Run the GitHub action `flight_compile` to execute the `sync â†’ build` process.

All the updated assets and the generated bundles will be automatically committed to this repo, and the packages released to NPM.
