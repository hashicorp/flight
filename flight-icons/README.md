# flight-icons

An addon for the icons from `flight`. Currently in development. This addon can be used in React or Ember apps.

## Installation

```bash
yarn add @hashicorp/flight-icons
```

## Usage

### How to choose 16 or 24 viewBox size

* If an icon is in a viewBox <= 16, use the `-16` version of the icon.
* If an icon is in a 16 < viewBox < 24, use your discretion. <!-- TBH I'm not sure, just put in a placeholder. -->
* If an icon is in a viewBox >= 24, use the `-24` version of the icon.

### Guidelines for other sizes

* If you're scaling an icon with a parent component or styling, do not stretch a `-16` icon to a `24` viewBox.
