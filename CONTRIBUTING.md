[![PRs Welcome](https://img.shields.io/badge/PRs-welcome-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](http://makeapullrequest.com)

## Figma assets pipeline

- For the sync/build/release scripts that export the assets from Figma and save them as multiple bundles, see [scripts/README](scripts/README.md).

_Notice: these scripts are still in development._

## sprite instructions

- To generate the sprite file, [sprite.svg](ember-flight-icons/public/icons/sprite.svg), follow the instructions in the README of [edenspiekermann/sprite.sh](https://github.com/edenspiekermann/sprite.sh) e.g.

```bash
npx spritesh -i src/svg/ -o ember-flight-icons/public/icons/sprite.svg
```

## npm instructions

### @hashicorp/ember-flight-icons

```bash
cd ember-flight-icons
```

Bump the version number for the `ember-flight/package.json`.

After the change is merged to `main`, from the `ember-flight-icons/` directory, run:

```bash
npm publish
```

You will need 2FA on your npm account to publish.

### @hashicorp/flight-icons

```bash
cd flight-icons
```

- Bump the version number for the `flight-icons/package.json`.

After the change is merged to `main`, from the `flight-icons/` directory, run:

```bash

You will need 2FA on your npm account to publish.

## How to test local addon changes

- `cd flight/ember-flight-icons` (or cd flight/flight-icons)
- Run `yarn link`. You'll get a response such as:

```bash
success Registered "@hashicorp/ember-flight-icons".
info You can now run `yarn link "@hashicorp/ember-flight-icons"` in the projects where you want to use this package and it will be used instead.
âœ¨  Done in 0.06s.
```

(If necessary, run a `yarn unlink`.)

- In your external repo, e.g. https://github.com/hashicorp/design-system-playground-fastboot, run `yarn link "@hashicorp/ember-flight-icons"`
- In your external repo, manually add the path to the `package.json`. For example:

```json
"devDependencies": {
  "@hashicorp/ember-flight-icons": "link:~/your-path-here/flight/ember-flight-icons",
}
```

- Run `yarn` or `yarn install`
- You may need to copy code such as https://github.com/hashicorp/flight/blob/main/ember-flight-icons/tests/dummy/app/templates/application.hbs into the external app's `application.hbs` to see the results.
- If you want to test local changes to `ember-flight-icons`, add `isDevelopingAddon` to `ember-flight-icons/index.js`. The file will look something like the following:

```js
'use strict';

module.exports = {
  name: require('./package').name,
  isDevelopingAddon() {
    return true;
  },
};
```
