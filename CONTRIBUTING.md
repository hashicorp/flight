## @hashicorp/flight-icons

See [flight-icons/CONTRIBUTING](flight-icons/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide for details on how to use the "sync/build/release" scripts, that export the assets from Figma and save them as multiple bundles in different formats (standalone SVGs, SVG sprite, CSS, etc.).

_Notice: these scripts are still in development._
